# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so**
> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used Terraform to streamline the infrastructure setup for our system. Navigating the Google Cloud Console proved to be cumbersome and resource-intensive on our laptops, so we found it much more efficient to manage everything through Terraform. Additionally, having our infrastructure defined as code provided a clear and organized overview of all resources, effectively serving as both documentation and a reproducible blueprint for our setup. We also used `Make` to group our calls to our scripts to automate our most recurrent development tasks.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed all project dependencies using uv, relying exclusively on the pyproject.toml and uv.lock files, and deliberately chose not to maintain requirements.txt files to keep dependency management streamlined. Dependencies were added and tracked using the `uv add` and `uv add --dev` commands, which ensured both production and development requirements were consistently recorded. To set up an identical development environment, a new team member would simply need to clone the repository and run `uv sync`, which installs all necessary packages as specified in the project files. Additionally, we used Make to organize and automate common development tasks, like running the API, tests, and training, through simple make commands. For containerized workflows, Docker is required used to ensure consistency across different systems. This approach makes onboarding straightforward and reproducible, as all environment specifications and automation scripts are version-controlled within the repository.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

From the cookiecutter template we have moved the content of the `src` folder in a `diabetic_classification` folder inside of it. We have used the `data.py`, `train.py` and `model.py` files. We have also added a `constants.py` file to store some useful values. We haven't used the `visualize.py` file, as well as the `evaluate,py` file for the evaluation is taken care of in `train.py`.

Furthermore, we have added the `.devops` folder that contains scripts useful for development, it splits it 2 sub-folders: `scripts` which contains classic bash scripts and a `python_scripts` subfolder. These scripts aren't intended to be called directly, but are called by the `Makefile`. Because we use make to organize our scripts, we have deleted the `tasks.py` file that makes us of invoke.

Finally, we have added an `infrastructure/` folder to hold all the Terraform-related files, as well as a `data/` folder that contains the dvc files as well as the

>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented a total of 13 unit and integration tests, not including our separate Locust performance tests. The majority of these tests focus on the most critical components of our application: data processing and the inference API. For data processing, we verify that data can be fetched, is correctly normalized, and is split into training and test sets according to the configuration. For the API, our tests ensure that models are properly loaded, can perform inference as expected, and that the model registry endpoint accurately reflects the available models.

>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Our workflow made extensive use of issues, branches, and pull requests to ensure a structured and collaborative development process. For each major task or feature, we first created a corresponding issue in GitHub. Team members would then assign themselves to an issue, create a dedicated branch for their work, and implement the required changes. Once the work was ready, a pull request (PR) was opened, which automatically triggered our continuous integration (CI) workflows to run all tests and code quality checks.

To maintain code quality and encourage peer review, we enforced branch protection rules: a PR could only be merged into the main branch after it had been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member, and only if all CI checks passed successfully. This approach helped us catch bugs early, maintain a clean main branch, and foster collaboration and accountability within the team. By linking issues to PRs, we also ensured that all work was traceable and that progress on tasks was clearly documented throughout the project.

### Question 10

>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:

> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

Our continuous integration (CI) setup ensures code quality, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility. We have two main workflows: one for linting and static analysis, and another for testing and building.

The linting workflow uses Ruff (configured via pyproject.toml) to check and enforce code formatting and style. It then runs mypy on the src and tests directories to verify type annotations and catch potential type errors. This workflow is triggered on every push to a branch with a pull request (PR), ensuring only well-formatted and type-safe code is merged.

The testing workflow is also triggered on every push to a PR branch, running all unit and integration tests to catch issues early. To optimize feedback, we split the tests into two parallel jobs: unit tests (which run quickly and do not require model files or API startup) and integration tests (which validate end-to-end functionality, including model loading and API endpoints). This parallelization allows us to catch errors rapidly while still thoroughly testing the full system. Caching is used to speed up uv dependency installation. To guarantee our code works across different environments, we run unit tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS using Python 3.12. This multi-platform testing helps us identify and resolve compatibility issues early.

The build workflow is only triggered when changes are merged into main. After all tests have passed and the PR is approved and merged, this workflow uses Google Cloud Build to build the docker images automatically. Integrating cloudbuild at this stage ensures that only thoroughly tested and reviewed code is built and ready to be deployed.

Examples of our triggered workflows:
- PR push:
    - Linting: https://github.com/02476-MLOps-2026-Group-128/02476_project/actions/runs/21282615447
    - Tests: https://github.com/02476-MLOps-2026-Group-128/02476_project/actions/runs/21278204599
- Main push (build): https://github.com/02476-MLOps-2026-Group-128/02476_project/actions/runs/21284357876
